My academic background combines a PhD in population genomics focused on recombination landscapes and ongoing research in comparative genomics and genome evolution, with a focus on understanding the diversity of structural variation across the eukaryotic tree of life. My work has allowed me to gain experience with Python/R programming in Unix environments, genomic data analysis, including variant calling and genotyping for a wide range of sequencing approaches (RAD-seq, RNA-seq, WGS, Pacbio long reads), and performing data analysis and population genetics inference, including simulations under diverse frameworks (msprime, SLiM). I have also actively engaged in meta-analyses to integrate large-scale genomic and life history trait datasets to understand evolutionary processes, such as the evolution of recombination landscapes across plant species.\nDuring my PhD (ANR HotRec), I leveraged large genomic datasets in a comparative genomic framework to understand global patterns of molecular evolution in plants. I used meta-analytic approaches and advanced statistics to describe and quantify the diversity and determinants of recombination and its associated evolutionary processes (e.g., GC-biased gene conversion) among a large set of plant species.\nAfter defending my PhD thesis in late 2022, I was rapidly involved in a wide range of themes spanning molecular evolution, population genomics, and evolutionary biology. My first postdoctoral position focused on testing an original theory of the evolution of gene expression (the runaway process proposed by Thomas Lenormand, ANR CisTransEvol). More recently, I have involved myself in the newly arising field of pangenomics and genomic structural variation (ERC funded, supervised by Claire Mérot). Among these widespread spectrum of topics, I have taken a broad view of population genomics, studying evolution at various levels of organization, including genes, genomes, populations, and species. I am interested in integrative approaches that reconcile different levels of organization under a more general and synthetic model (e.g., how patterns at the scale of genes could influence global genome evolution, and how both are co-evolving).\nI am also a continuous learner, very curious and eager to train myself in a broad range of topics and methods in evolutionary genomics. I am involved in the development of bioinformatic pipelines and packages (structural variants calling, recombination maps) as well as the development of modern statistical methods for population genomics, especially Bayesian inference, Machine Learning and Neural Networks (ABC + Bayesian Neural Networks). In particular, I am actively developing Bayesian neural networks methods for inference of demographic parameters in an Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. Deep Learning is getting more and more attention in population genomics, and I believe it is a powerful versatile approach for inferences and predictions on large scale genomic data with complex underlying models and non-linear relationships in high-dimension datasets.\nDownload my full academic resume or a concise resume .\n","date":1746403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":1746403200,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am an evolutionary biologist and population geneticist broadly interested in genome evolution and patterns of genetic diversity across genomes, populations, and species.

This challenge is particularly acute in population genetics, evolutionary biology, and systems biology, where both coalescent and forward-time simulators can generate data under sophisticated models, but the corresponding likelihood functions remain intractable.\nApproximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) provides a likelihood-free framework for parameter inference in such settings. The fundamental principle of ABC relies on the intuition that simulated data sets with summary statistics close to those observed are likely to have been generated by similar parameter values.\nRecent advances in deep learning offer promising solutions to preform likelihood-free parameter inference in a Bayesian framework.

In some species, mating partners move exclusively for mating, dispersing genes but not individuals. This is the case in many bat species, of which the lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus hipposideros) shows a genetic structure at a fine spatial scale suggesting restricted dispersal. We investigated how natal and mating dispersal shape gene flow in this species in two meta-populations using paternity and population assignments. Half of the inferred paternities were intra-colonial and gave an estimate of the mean mating dispersal distance of around 11 km, explaining the observed genetic structure. Complete gametic dispersal distances were further estimated by combining natal with mating dispersal distances. The resulting gametic dispersal kernels showed a mean distance of around 20 km and a fat-tailed distribution typical of an excess of long-distance dispersal movements. It is the first time that natal and mating dispersal distances have been separately estimated and then combined in animals, documenting quantitatively how mating dispersal decorrelates gene and individual flows. It is important to consider this mechanism to explain dispersal evolution.","tags":null,"title":"The geometry of gametic dispersal in a flying mammal, Rhinolophus hipposideros","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This preprint is now published in Molecular Biology and Evolution.\n","date":1721481246,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721481246,"objectID":"e1b55b3d7ef3ab8e6c79c353943f7684","permalink":"https://example.com/post/recombination-gradients/","publishdate":"2024-07-20T13:14:06.043Z","relpermalink":"/post/recombination-gradients/","section":"post","summary":"This preprint is now published in Molecular Biology and Evolution.","tags":null,"title":"New publication: Diversity in Recombination Hotspot Characteristics and Gene Structure Shape Fine-Scale Recombination Patterns in Plant Genomes","type":"post"},{"authors":["Thomas Brazier","Sylvain Glémin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1721470260,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721470260,"objectID":"e1da77d2126bf73bcfacbeacdb29232a","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/recombination-gradients/","publishdate":"2024-07-20T10:11:00.76Z","relpermalink":"/publication/recombination-gradients/","section":"publication","summary":"During the meiosis of many eukaryote species, crossovers tend to occur within narrow regions called recombination hotspots. In plants, it is generally thought that gene regulatory sequences, especially promoters and 5′ to 3′ untranslated regions, are enriched in hotspots, but this has been characterized in a handful of species only. We also lack a clear description of fine-scale variation in recombination rates within genic regions and little is known about hotspot position and intensity in plants. To address this question, we constructed fine-scale recombination maps from genetic polymorphism data and inferred recombination hotspots in 11 plant species. We detected gradients of recombination in genic regions in most species, yet gradients varied in intensity and shape depending on specific hotspot locations and gene structure. To further characterize recombination gradients, we decomposed them according to gene structure by rank and number of exons. We generalized the previously observed pattern that recombination hotspots are organized around the boundaries of coding sequences, especially 5′ promoters. However, our results also provided new insight into the relative importance of the 3′ end of genes in some species and the possible location of hotspots away from genic regions in some species. Variation among species seemed driven more by hotspot location among and within genes than by differences in size or intensity among species. Our results shed light on the variation in recombination rates at a very fine scale, revealing the diversity and complexity of genic recombination gradients emerging from the interaction between hotspot location and gene structure.","tags":null,"title":"Diversity in Recombination Hotspot Characteristics and Gene Structure Shape Fine-Scale Recombination Patterns in Plant Genomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My second PhD paper about meiotic recombination in plants is now accessible as a preprint in BioRXiv.\nWe found that recombination hostpots are ubiquitous in plant genic regions, mostly in promoters and terminators.

To date, the broad diversity of recombination landscapes among plants has rarely been investigated and a formal comparative genomic approach is still needed to characterize and assess the determinants of recombination landscapes among species and chromosomes. We gathered genetic maps and genomes for 57 flowering plant species, corresponding to 665 chromosomes, for which we estimated large-scale recombination landscapes. We found that the number of crossover per chromosome spans a limited range (between one to five/six) whatever the genome size, and that there is no single relationship across species between genetic map length and chromosome size. Instead, we found a general relationship between the relative size of chromosomes and recombination rate, while the absolute length constrains the basal recombination rate for each species. At the chromosome level, we identified two main patterns (with a few exceptions) and we proposed a conceptual model explaining the broad-scale distribution of crossovers where both telomeres and centromeres play a role.
