      <title>ABC with Bayesian Neural networks</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Modern population genomics inference increasingly relies on complex stochastic models for which likelihood functions are either analytically intractable or computationally prohibitive to evaluate. This challenge is particularly acute in population genetics, evolutionary biology, and systems biology, where both coalescent and forward-time simulators can generate data under sophisticated models, but the corresponding likelihood functions remain intractable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) provides a likelihood-free framework for parameter inference in such settings. The fundamental principle of ABC relies on the intuition that simulated data sets with summary statistics close to those observed are likely to have been generated by similar parameter values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent advances in deep learning offer promising solutions to preform likelihood-free parameter inference in a Bayesian framework. Neural networks can learn complex mappings between high-dimensional summary statistics and parameter spaces, effectively learning an implicit likelihood or posterior approximation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;thomasbrazier.github.io/abcneuralnet/&#34;&gt;abcneuralnet&lt;/a&gt; R package implements four state-of-the-art Bayesian deep learning approaches:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Concrete Dropout: Provides rigorous uncertainty quantification through approximate variational inference, specifically a refinement of dropout as variational Bayesian approximation where the dropout rate is learned during inference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monte Carlo Dropout: A simpler dropout approach, which offers uncertainty estimation through stochastic forward passes, yet requiring careful tuning of the dropout rate hyper-parameter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deep Ensemble: A highly efficient ensemble approach delivering robust predictions through model averaging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TabNet-ABC: Combines interpretable attention mechanisms with traditional ABC regression&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each method addresses different aspects of the ABC inference problem, with their own advantages and limitations, while maintaining compatibility with existing ABC workflows and providing rigorous uncertainty quantification essential for scientific inference.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poster SSMPG 2025: Bayesian Deep Learning and ABC for Population Genomics Inference</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/poster-ssmpg/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I presented my work on Bayesian Deep Learning and ABC for Population Genomics Inference at the Summer School on Software and Statistical Methods for Population Genomics 2025 &lt;a href=&#34;https://ssmpg2025.sciencesconf.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;workshop&lt;/a&gt; in the French Alps. The poster presenting the method and the R package is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ThomasBrazier/starter-hugo-academic/blob/main/statics/uploads/poster_ssmpg2025.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) has emerged as a powerful framework for parameter inference in complex statistical models where likelihood functions are intractable. However, traditional ABC methods face significant computational challenges when dealing with high-dimensional summary statistics and complex parameter spaces. The R package &lt;strong&gt;abcneuralnet&lt;/strong&gt; integrates Bayesian deep learning with ABC to address these challenges. We demonstrate four methodological approaches: Concrete Dropout (Gal et al 2017), Monte Carlo Dropout (Gal et al 2016), Deep Ensemble (Lakshminarayanan et al 2016), and TabNet-ABC (Arik et al 2020; Akesson et al 2022). Each method provides different strategies for uncertainty quantification and parameter inference, combining the representational power of deep neural networks with principled Bayesian inference. Through comprehensive examples, we illustrate the theoretical foundations, practical implementation, and performance characteristics of these methods for parameter inference in population genetics and related fields.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New publication:  Mating system and the evolution of recombination rates in seed plants</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/mating-system-recombination/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A new paper published in &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1093/jeb/voaf008&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Journal of Evolutionary Biology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meiotic recombination is a central mechanism underlying sexual reproduction among eukaryotes. In many species, the recombination rate is strongly constrained by chromosome size, as the number of crossovers per chromosome generally ranges between one and no more than a few (around three to five). Yet, recombination rates are variable and can evolve between species, in particular when they differ in their reproductive system. According to theory, indirect selection towards higher recombination rates is expected to be stronger in inbred populations, such as selfing species compared with randomly mating species. To test for the impact of the mating system on the evolution of recombination rates, we leveraged a dataset with genetic maps, genome sizes, chromosome numbers, and life history traits in 200 seed plant species. After controlling for the chromosome size effect, the phylogeny, and map quality, we found a joint positive effect of the mating system and longevity on recombination rates, with higher recombination rates in mixed-mating and selfing species. We also found that mixed-mating and selfing species had a significantly higher number of crossovers in larger chromosomes than outcrossing species, suggesting selection for relaxed crossover interference in these former species. Our results point to the mating system as an important factor potentially shaping the evolution of recombination despite mechanical constraints acting on the number of crossovers per chromosome.&lt;/p&gt;

I presented this work at the Evolution 2025 virtual session. The slides of the talk are

      <title>New preprint: Ubiquitous recombination gradients within plant genic regions shaped by recombination hotspots</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My second PhD paper about meiotic recombination in plants is now accessible as a preprint in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.12.571209v1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BioRXiv&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found that recombination hostpots are ubiquitous in plant genic regions, mostly in promoters and terminators. As a consequence of this pattern, plant genic regions sequences experience recombination gradients along the coding sequence, and the middle of genes recombine less than the edge. You can find out more in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.12.571209v1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;preprint&lt;/a&gt; awaiting for a good peer review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New publication: Diversity and determinants of recombination landscapes in flowering plants</title>
      <link>https://example.com/post/diversity-and-determinants-of-recombination-landscapes-in-flowering-plants/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My new paper about meiotic recombination in plants is now published in &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010141&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PLOS Genetics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meiotic recombination is a universal feature of sexually reproducing species. During meiosis, crossovers play a fundamental role for the proper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis and reshuffles alleles among chromosomes. How much variation in recombination is expected within a genome and among different species remains a central question for understanding the evolution of recombination. We characterized and compared recombination landscapes in a large set of plant species with a wide range of genome size. We found that the number of crossovers varied little among species, from one mandatory to no more than five or six crossovers per chromosomes, whatever the genome size. However, we identified two main patterns of variation along chromosomes (with a few exceptions) that can be explained by a new conceptual model where chromosome length, chromosome structure and gene density play a role. The strong association between gene density and recombination was already known, but raised new questions not only about the evolution of recombination rates but also on their distribution along chromosomes.&lt;/p&gt;
